An open source USB-controlled potentiostat/galvanostat.

I started this project because I needed a potentiostat/galvanostat that suited my research on thin-film lithium-ion batteries. Commercial offers exist, but even a basic model will easily set you back €6000. Moreover, I didn't like dealing with closed, non-user-serviceable hardware and putting up with the manufacturer's buggy software. So I designed and built my own, for a parts cost of about €50.

This repository contains everything necessary to replicate the design. It consists of a circuit schematic and PCB layout made with KiCad, microcontroller firmware and source code written in C, and a demonstration program written in LabVIEW to run typical electrochemical measurements.
